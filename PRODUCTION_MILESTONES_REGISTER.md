# Production Milestones Register

Created: 2025-08-17T00:00:00Z

This file registers the prioritized milestone plan and records the beginning of the production hardening work.

Recent actions started here:
- Implemented request tracing redaction and a STRICT_JSON toggle in `backend/server.js` to avoid logging sensitive data and to enable strict body validation for production.

Next planned steps (short):
1. Harden secrets: move credentials to CI/Vault and remove from repo.
2. Add GitHub Actions pipeline (lint, unit, SCA).
3. Instrument observability (OpenTelemetry + Jaeger) and centralize logs.
