```

All changes successfully pushed to `origin/master`.

### 3. ⚠️ Security Vulnerabilities Identified
**Status**: DOCUMENTED - ACTION REQUIRED  
**Severity**: 2 Moderate Vulnerabilities

#### Details:
- **Count**: 2 moderate vulnerabilities (updated from initial report of 4)
- **Location**: GitHub Dependabot detected issues in dependencies
- **View Alerts**: https://github.com/lenchoajema/frontend/security/dependabot

#### Why Not Fixed Yet:
- `npm` is not available in the current Alpine Linux environment
- Requires either:
  - Installing Node.js/npm in Alpine (`apk add nodejs npm` - needs sudo)
  - Using Docker container with npm
  - Using GitHub Dependabot (recommended)
