## Next Steps: Security Vulnerabilities

### Issue
The system reported 4 security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, `npm` is not currently available in the Alpine Linux environment.

### Resolution Options

#### Option 1: Install Node.js and npm in Alpine
```bash
# Requires root/sudo access
apk add --no-cache nodejs npm

# Then run security fixes
npm audit fix
npm audit fix --force  # For breaking changes
```

#### Option 2: Use Docker Container
```bash
# If backend runs in Docker container
docker exec -it <backend-container-name> npm audit fix
docker exec -it <backend-container-name> npm audit fix --force
```

#### Option 3: Manual Package Updates
Common vulnerabilities in Node.js projects typically involve:
- Outdated `axios` versions
- Outdated `express` versions
- Outdated testing libraries
- Outdated OpenTelemetry packages

Update package.json dependencies to latest stable versions:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.7.9",  // Already latest
    "express": "^4.21.1",  // Update from 4.19.2
    // ... other packages
  }
}
```

#### Option 4: GitHub Dependabot (Recommended)
GitHub's Dependabot will automatically create pull requests to fix security vulnerabilities. Review and merge those PRs to resolve the issues.

## Resolution Script Created
Two utility scripts have been added to the repository:
1. `resolve-conflicts.sh` - Bash script for future conflict resolution
2. `resolve_conflicts.py` - Python script for automated conflict resolution

These can be used in the future if merge conflicts arise again.
