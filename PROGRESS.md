## ⚠️ Current Issues & Technical Debt

### 🐛 Critical Issues
1. **Empty Backend**: Backend folder exists but is empty - no API implementation
2. **API Endpoints**: All API calls point to localhost:5000 but no backend server exists
3. **Authentication Flow**: Incomplete session restoration logic (commented out code)
4. **Test Coverage**: Minimal test coverage, basic tests may fail

### ⚠️ Code Quality Issues
1. **Commented Code**: Large sections of commented code in App.js suggest incomplete refactoring
2. **Deprecated Packages**: Multiple npm warnings about deprecated dependencies
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: 16 npm audit vulnerabilities (1 low, 6 moderate, 9 high)
4. **Console Logs**: Debug console.log statements throughout the code

### 🔧 Configuration Issues
1. **Environment Variables**: Hardcoded API URLs need proper environment configuration
2. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns
3. **Loading States**: Some components lack proper loading state management

## 📋 Next Priority Tasks

### 🚀 High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. **Implement Backend API**
   - Set up Node.js/Express server
   - Implement authentication endpoints
   - Create product CRUD operations
   - Set up cart and order management APIs
   - Configure database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)

2. **Fix Authentication Flow**
   - Clean up commented code in App.js
   - Implement proper session restoration
   - Add route protection
   - Improve error handling

3. **Security & Dependencies**
   - Update deprecated npm packages
   - Fix security vulnerabilities
   - Implement proper environment configuration
   - Add input validation and sanitization

### 🎯 Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up comprehensive test suite
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Add integration tests for user flows
   - Set up test coverage reporting

5. **Code Quality & Documentation**
   - Remove debug console.log statements
   - Clean up commented code
   - Add proper TypeScript (optional)
   - Improve code documentation
   - Set up ESLint/Prettier configuration

6. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Implement real-time inventory updates
   - Add product reviews and ratings
   - Implement advanced search and filtering
   - Add wishlist functionality
   - Implement order tracking

### 🌟 Long-term Goals (Month 2+)
7. **Performance & Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for components
   - Add image optimization
   - Set up caching strategies
   - Optimize bundle size

8. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time notifications
   - Multi-language support
   - Advanced analytics dashboard
   - Mobile app development
   - Third-party integrations

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- **Frontend Completion**: ~75% (Core functionality implemented)
- **Backend Completion**: 0% (Needs complete implementation)
- **Testing Coverage**: ~5% (Basic setup only)
- **Documentation**: ~40% (README exists, needs API docs)
- **Security**: ⚠️ Needs attention (vulnerabilities present)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 19.0.0
- Redux Toolkit 2.5.0

## 📞 Next Steps Recommendation

**Immediate Actions (Next 48 hours):**
1. Set up backend API structure
2. Implement basic authentication endpoints
3. Connect frontend to working backend
4. Test end-to-end user registration/login flow

**This Week:**
1. Complete backend implementation for core features
2. Fix all security vulnerabilities
3. Clean up code quality issues
4. Add comprehensive error handling

The project shows strong frontend development progress with a solid architecture. The main blocker is the missing backend implementation, which should be the immediate focus to make the application fully functional.
